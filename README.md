# easy-iceberg
A couple cool and simple examples of Apache Iceberg in action. 

In particular, they show why Apache Iceberg is even cooler than:
- Hive on its own 
- any kind of database (example in use: PostgreSQL)

## What we got here?
The repository contains two examples

- [Example 1 - Iceberg Example - Concurrency](notebooks/Iceberg Example - Concurrency.ipynb)
- [Example 2 - Iceberg Example - Partitioning](notebooks/Iceberg Example - Partitioning.ipynb)

## How to run in my own machine
If you want to run this on your own machine, you can use *batect*.

Simply run ```./batect dev``` and it will start the notebook server 
for you, mounting everything into it.
